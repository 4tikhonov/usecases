# CLARIAH-PLUS use cases

## Introduction

This repository collects **all** use cases for CLARIAH-PLUS, across all work
packages and interest groups. Our aim is to have a central repository where
everybody can get insight into the wide variety of use cases we currently deal
with. With this transparency with intend to foster cooperation and provide a basis
for discussion and implementation, both in the CLARIAH interest groups and beyond.

At this stage, the structure of the use cases is still very much open-ended, we
intend to first gather use cases and in a later stage distill a more structured
format.

## How to contribute?

Everybody working in CLARIAH is welcome and encouraged to contribute his/her
use cases. Please see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [template](TEMPLATE.md).

## Use cases

The below listing links to all use cases based on their state, but in no further particular order, better ordering will be applied at a later stage and is all subject to further discussion as we grow.
